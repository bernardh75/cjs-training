1. In my mind, tests are useless for situations where :
- the code, the function to test is relatively simple
- writing tests is more complex than writing code
- passing or failing the test is difficult to define
- if a non-reproducible bug
- if it is already covered by another more general test 


2. The tests are used to show the presence of defects, not their absence.
Because their goal is to see if the program meets expectations correctly in a specific case, otherwise we have an error.
Without error, however, this does not mean that there are no faults, but that our case works.


3. By UI acceptand test we are testing what the users see (we check if the UI for the web application works fine without any defect) 
and by API test puts much more emphasis on the testing of business logic, data responses and security, and performance. 
Some API test could replace UI Test for example, because the UI calls APIs to change his state... 


4. The International Software Testing Qualifications Board cerification are several benefits : 
- A good knowledge of testing best practice
- International recognition of acquired competencies and skills
As limits we have : 
- need to develop skills in testing


5. The Agile method in my day-to-day experience has many advantages :
- Better communication with the client through the PO, useful if the need evolves
- The delivery is faster partial at each sprint we have added value
- More flexibility in terms of schedules, adjustments ...
- The entire agile team participates in agile ceremonies and are at the heart of decisions ...
Agile method has also some inconvenients : 
- lack of predictability
- not enough docs


6. Regression testing refers to a type of software testing that is used to verify any modification or update in a software without affecting the overall working functionality of the said software.


7. As CI tools we have Jenkins and Travis CI.
Jenkins is a open-source CI/CD tool that is in usage for a long time. The tool is written entirely in Java. Jenkins has a set of features that can be used to build, test, and integrate changes in a project.
Like Jenkins, Travis CI is also one of the early players in the CI/CD tools market. Travis is written in Ruby and is developed and maintained by the Travis CI community.


8. BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development and it's a extension of Test Driven Development concept but instead of testing our code we are testing our product, it's behaves.
Cucumbe.js is a framework that runs automated acceptance tests written in a BDD style. It works by allowing you to define your tests in Gherkin form, and makes these gherkins executable by tying them to code.

Best to worst : 
1. #loginButton
2. //a[contains(@class,"header_login")]//input[@id="login_btn"]
3. //*[@id=‚Äùheader-banner-1"]/bcdk-mandatory-action-dialog/div/div[2]/button[2]
